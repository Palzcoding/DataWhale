These are practical data analysis projects I done accompanied with my learning of "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes Mcknney. 
Bridge the gap between theory and real-world application and boost a comprehensive understanding of data analysis processes.
Thanks to DataWhale team who set the guidelines.
