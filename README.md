These are practical data analysis projects I done accompanied with my learning of "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes Mcknney, primarily based on Numpy, Pandas, and sklearn.    
Bridge the gap between theory and real-world application and boost a comprehensive understanding of data analysis processes.  
Thanks to DataWhale team who set the guidelines.
